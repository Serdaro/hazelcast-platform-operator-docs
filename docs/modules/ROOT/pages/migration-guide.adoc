= Migrating to 5.5

- `backupType` field is removed:
```
hazelcast:
  persistence:
    backupType:
```
If you are using this field in the version 5.4, you should not set it anymore in 5.5.

- `bucketURI` and `secret` fields are wrapped under `bucketConfig` field.

==== Before:
```
hazelcast:
  persistence:
    restore:
      bucketURI:
      secret:
```
==== After:
```
hazelcast:
  persistence:
    restore:
      bucketConfig:
        bucketURI:
        secret:
```

- `schedule` field is removed from `HotBackup`. `CronHotBackup` must be used instead.

==== Before:
```
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: HotBackup
metadata:
  name: hot-backup
spec:
  hazelcastResourceName: hazelcast
  schedule: "* * * * *"
```

==== After:
```
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: CronHotBackup
metadata:
  name: cronhotbackup
spec:
  schedule: "*/30 * * * *"
  hotBackupTemplate:
    metadata:
      labels:
        cron-hotbackup: "true"
    spec:
      hazelcastResourceName: hazelcast
```

- `mapResourceName` field renamed as `resources` and WAN Replication with multiple resources support is added.

==== Before:
```
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: WanReplication
metadata:
  name: wanreplication-sample
spec:
  mapResourceName: map
  targetClusterName: dev
  endpoints: "35.192.33.252"
```

==== After:
```
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
